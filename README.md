# Thesis Code Repository

This repository belongs to Sara García De Fuentes and serves as a companion to the project presented in the Business Analytics and Management master’s thesis, Customer Growth Reimagined: A Case Study on Data-Driven Commercial Strategy at Gregorio Díez.

It provides an overview of the methodology, organized according to the main stages described in the thesis document.

## Repository Structure
The repository contains separate scripts organized by stage of the analytical workflow:

1. Double Clustering.py
Performs dual behavioral segmentation using K‑means.

2. Gradient Boosting Potential Identification.py
Implements demand prediction via Gradient Boosting Regressor, achieving 90% confidence intervals, and classified clients for growth opportunities.

3. Recommendation Algorithms.py
Evaluates and generates product-level recommendations benchmarking them against a random selection system.


## Repository Scope Disclaimer
Methods included: Core workflows for data processing, demand forecasting, and recommendation generation that reproduce the thesis’s main results.

Methods excluded: Data preprocessing, visualisation codes, profiling/summary statistics or alternate algorithms, are described in the thesis but not in these scripts, which prioritize clarity and usability.

Data not included: Input datasets (2023_DATOS, 2023_DATOS_CLUSTERED.xlsx and 2024_DATOS_CLEAN.xlsx) are not provided due to privacy constraints.
